Data-Science-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
==============================================

This repo contains the R code, its output and documentation for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Module of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization track.

The dataset being used is: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a>


# Files

Description of the files in this repo are as follows:
* run_analysis.R is the file containing the R code for the project. The file is well documented and so (hopefully) it is easy to read and understand what is going on.
* CodeBook.md describes the data, the variables and the transformations done to the data to tidy it.
* dataAverageSubjectActivity.txt is the output of the run_analysis.R file that contains a cleaned up dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Instruction

The R code file can be run by simply importing it into R or RStudio provided the above mentioned dataset is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
